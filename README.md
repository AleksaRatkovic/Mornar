## Mornar-Java

My first project in Java, which is homework on class called Object-oriented programming 2 on my Faculty.
This is not my compulsory subject, so I have done it on my own.
Also this is my first attempt to use Git, and so I had some problems when i tried to do last push and so my commits aren't the best.
